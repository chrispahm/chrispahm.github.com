<h1>How to build a blog in less than 100 lines of code</h1><info datetime="">

<p>Iâ€™ve been thinking about writing a blog for quite some time. There are a couple of reasons that were motivating me to get started: One point was that I thought I should write down and comment on some of the code that I write, so I could get back to it at a later stage more easily, or just use it as a reference. A further reason was this wonderful conversation I had with <a class="link" href="https://github.com/chrispahm/chartjs-plugin-dragdata/issues/23#issuecomment-512803640">Vanessa Sochat</a> (still makes me super happy to read!). And finally, I wanted to get better at writing!</p>
<p>As of right now, Iâ€™m painfully slow at writing, and to be honest, I donâ€™t like at all that much. Especially in the scientific context, Iâ€™m regularly procrastinating instead of just getting started with a manuscript. However, that is about to change! Well, at least I hope so, as I want to gain more writing practice when working on this blog ðŸ˜„</p>
<p>Alright, so for writing a blog, you actually need to set-up a blog somewhere. My requirements were simple: I wanted to host it on GitHub pages, have the actual posts written in <a class="link" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, and wanted as little setup/overhead as possible.</p>
<p>My first try was setting up <a class="link" href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll">Jekyll</a> on GithHub pages. After deciding on the beautiful <a class="link" href="http://chalk.nielsenramon.com/">Chalk</a> theme, I started following the documentation on how to get things up and running.</p>
<p><a class="link" href="http://chalk.nielsenramon.com/"><img src="http://chalk.nielsenramon.com/assets/documentation/chalk-intro@2x-d0c0ee7141c3804d3a7c0db8992cbbb8248913a9f85923f1d3fa8343093978f0.png" alt="Chalk"></a></p>
<p>The documentation is well written, however I was a little intimidated by its length. Install the software, prepare the git repo, understand local site testing, get to know how to add new posts/sites, read through the Chalk documentation to learn about customization. It all felt like a greater commitment than I initially intended. So after forking Chalk, I ended up not working on it for 3+ months.</p>
<p>Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, the whole blog idea came up once again. Thinking about whether to continue work on the Jekyll based blog, I came to the conclusion that writing a static site generator myself shouldnâ€™t be all that hard. Conceptually, I thought that I would need a template <code>html</code> file, and a directory for my markdown posts. I also wanted to have a <code>projects</code> and an <code>about</code> page. Here, I thought writing these in <code>html</code> would be preferable, as that would give me more options on the individual styling than with parsed Markdown. Regarding the design, I wanted to closely stick to the wonderful blog by <a class="link" href="https://rsms.me/">Rasmus Andersson</a>. I especially love his <a class="link" href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter typeface</a>, which I plan to use on more upcoming projects.</p>

<p>The image above shows the actual file structure. The overarching <code>index.html</code>, containing the header and footer, as well as the content divâ€™s for the about and projects page are stored in the <code>template</code> folder. As mentioned earlier, the <code>posts</code> directory contains the Markdown files. And thatâ€™s basically it! Sure, there is a top level <code>assets</code> folder where the <code>.css</code> and other static resources live, but all in all there is not much magic to the general setup.</p>
