# blog
Welcome to the source code of my blog ðŸŒ·

## Getting started
If you like the design/setup of the blog and might want to use it for yourself (or just play around with the codebase) please feel free to use it!

In order to get started, you need to make sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then:

1) [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) or [clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository
2) In a terminal window, navigate to the folder where your clone/fork resides
(e.g `cd C:\Users\YourUsername\documents\blog`)
3) In the terminal, type `npm install` (and enter), which will install all necessary packages
4) Subsequently, type `npm run dev` (follwed by enter). This will start a live server of your blog (typically on `localhost:8080`). You can now start writing new (Markdown) posts in the `src/posts` directory. Make sure that the filename does not contain spaces! You can find a working example in the `static-site-generator.md` blog post. The blog should update itself automatically according to your changes.

When you are happy with your blog and want it to be published, just commit your changes to Github and setup a [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for your repo. And that's it! Happy coding :)
