title: Operations research in ObservableHQ
preview: Just recently I learned about Observables (reactive notebooks in JavaScript), 
  and I'm a huge fan already 😍. One of the neat things you can use them for is 
  writing optimisation models (including beautiful visualisations and markup) that anyone can
  run and edit right from the browser. Check it out! 👀
