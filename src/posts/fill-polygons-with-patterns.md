title: Filling polygons with patterns in Mapbox GL JS ðŸŒˆ
preview: I have been (once again) trying to visualize the crops cultivated on a farms fields in map. 
  Due to the amount of crops on a farm, solely using colors for distinguishing crops isn't working that well.
  While browsing for inspiration I then stumbled upon a neat demo illustrating the use of color patterns.
  Check out the Observable to find out how to include such patterns in a Mapbox map!
