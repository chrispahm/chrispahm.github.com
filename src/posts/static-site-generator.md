# How to build a blog (static site generator) in less than 100 lines of code

I've been thinking about writing a blog for quite some time. There are a couple of reasons that were motivating me to get started: One point was that I thought I should write down and comment on some of the code that I write, so I could get back to it at a later stage more easily, or just use it as a reference. A further reason was this super motivating discussion I had with [Vanessa Sochat]() (thank you so much once again!). And finally, I wanted to get better at writing!

As of right now, I'm painfully slow at writing, and to be honest, I don't like at all that much. Especially in the scientific context, I'm regularly procrastinating instead of just getting started with a manuscript. However, that is about to change! Well, at least I hope so, as I hope to gain more writing practice when working on this blog :)

Alright, so for writing a blog, you actually need to set-up a blog somewhere. There are a ton of options out there, and to be honest, I didn't consider all to many of them. [WordPress](),
