# How to build a blog in less than 100 lines of code

I've been thinking about writing a blog for quite some time. There are a couple of reasons that were motivating me to get started: One point was that I thought I should write down and comment on some of the code that I write, so I could get back to it at a later stage more easily, or just use it as a reference. A further reason was this wonderful conversation I had with [Vanessa Sochat](https://github.com/chrispahm/chartjs-plugin-dragdata/issues/23#issuecomment-512803640) (still makes me super happy to read!). And finally, I wanted to get better at writing!

As of right now, I'm painfully slow at writing, and to be honest, I don't like at all that much. Especially in the scientific context, I'm regularly procrastinating instead of just getting started with a manuscript. However, that is about to change! Well, at least I hope so, as I want to gain more writing practice when working on this blog ðŸ˜„

Alright, so for writing a blog, you actually need to set-up a blog somewhere. My requirements were simple: I wanted to host it on GitHub pages, have the actual posts written in [Markdown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and wanted as little setup/overhead as possible.

My first try was setting up [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) on GithHub pages. After deciding on the beautiful [Chalk](http://chalk.nielsenramon.com/) theme, I started following the documentation on how to get things up and running. 

[![Chalk](http://chalk.nielsenramon.com/assets/documentation/chalk-intro@2x-d0c0ee7141c3804d3a7c0db8992cbbb8248913a9f85923f1d3fa8343093978f0.png)](http://chalk.nielsenramon.com/)

The documentation is well written, however I was a little intimidated by its length. Install the software, prepare the git repo, understand local site testing, get to know how to add new posts/sites, read through the Chalk documentation to learn about customization. It all felt like a greater commitment than I initially intended. So after forking Chalk, I ended up not working on it for 3+ months.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, the whole blog idea came up once again. Thinking about whether to continue work on the Jekyll based blog, I came to the conclusion that writing a static site generator myself shouldn't be all that hard. Conceptually, I thought that I would need a template `html` file, and a directory for my markdown posts. I also wanted to have a `projects` and an `about` page. Here, I thought writing these in `html` would be preferable, as that would give me more options on the individual styling than with parsed Markdown. Regarding the design, I wanted to closely stick to the wonderful blog by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/). I especially love his [Inter typeface](https://rsms.me/inter/), which I plan to use on more upcoming projects.

*The basic file structure of the static site generator*

The image above shows the actual file structure. The overarching `index.html`, containing the header and footer, as well as the content div's for the about and projects page are stored in the `template` folder. As mentioned earlier, the `posts` directory contains the Markdown files. And that's basically it! Sure, there is a top level `assets` folder where the `.css` and other static resources live, but all in all there is not much magic to the general setup. 

Let's dive into the code. I write most of my projects in JavaScript (JS) / [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (especially everything web related), and also used Node.js for this project. To be honest, I am not religious about coding languages, and highly believe that most of the things I do could be done in Python/Go/YourFavoriteProgrammingLanguage/Rust even faster, more performant or generally better (you could rant about this if there was a comment section). However, working in the web area requires you to know JavaScript at least to some degree. And then again, I'm a lazy person that knows his way around JS pretty well. So in essence, that's why I eventually end up writing most of my stuff in JS. 

For a start, we'll be looking into the `index.js` file that hosts the main logic. In order to be able to read our markdown posts, and the contents of our `template` folder, we'll be requiring the native `fs` module, as well as some methods from `path` module.
To show an estimated reading time at the beginning of the article, the [`reading-time`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reading-time) package is used. At the beginning of the markdown posts, meta-data such as the posts title, a short preview of the article for the main page, as well as some keywords are stored in `YAML` format. We can read this meta-data using the [`yaml-front-matter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml-front-matter) package.

```js
const fs = require('fs') 
const { extname, basename } = require('path') 
const { promisify } = require('util')
const readingTime = require('reading-time')
const yamlFront = require('yaml-front-matter')
const helpers = require('./helpers')

const readdir = promisify(fs.readdir)
const readFile = promisify(fs.readFile)
const stats = promisify(fs.stat)
```

As you may have already guessed from the use of the `promisify` method (exported by the native `util` package), I'm a huge fan of [`promises`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), and even more so of the [`async/await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) sugar. In order to use the `async/await` keyword for asynchronously reading files etc., we'll wrap the main logic in a self invoking `async` function:

```js
;
(async () => {
  // the main logic goes here, so we can use the await keyword
})()
```

Ok so first off, we start by reading the `index.html` template file, containing our page header and footer.
The `formatter` is created so that we can show a short date string in the post preview of the landing page (e.g. *Feb 2020*).
We proceed to get a list of all files in the `posts` directory, and filter the list by files with the extension `.md` (â†’ markdown).

```js
;
(async () => {
  const template = await readFile('./src/template/index.html', 'utf8')
  const formatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en', {
    month: 'short'
  })
  // read the entire posts directory and filter for markdown files
  let posts = await readdir('./src/posts')
  posts = posts.filter(post => extname(post) === '.md')
```

We then proceed to loop through all the posts that were found. For each post,
we create an object with properties for all the meta-info that we parsed from the `YAML` front-matter.
In addition, we add properties such as the estimated reading time, as well as year, month and date of creation for later use.
Eventually, we update the array that contained a path string of our current post with the newly created object.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < posts.length; i++) {
  // read file content, parse yaml front-matter and markdown content
  // and store info in posts array
  const string = await readFile(`./src/posts/${posts[i]}`, 'utf8')
  const {
    birthtime
  } = await stats(`./src/posts/${posts[i]}`)
  const parsed = yamlFront.loadFront(string)
  parsed.date = new Date(birthtime)
  parsed.month = formatter.format(parsed.date)
  parsed.year = parsed.date.getFullYear()
  parsed.readingTime = readingTime(parsed.__content).text
  parsed.rendered = helpers.renderAndInsertDate(parsed)
  parsed.file = basename(posts[i], '.md')
  posts[i] = parsed
}
```

From then on, it's a piece of cake. Given our template `html`, we  start by 
creating our landing page. The landing page will have a preview of the latest 15 posts and it's main contents. The post previews are specified in the `YAML` front-matter of each post.

```js
// create the landing page (index.html)
// get a string of the first 15 posts and create previews
const previewString = posts.slice(0, 14).map(helpers.postPreview).join('\n')
await helpers.prepareSite('index.html', template, previewString)

// create about page
const aboutString = await readFile('./src/template/about.html', 'utf8')
await helpers.prepareSite('about/index.html', template, aboutString)

// create projects page
const projectsString = await readFile('./src/template/projects.html', 'utf8')
await helpers.prepareSite('projects/index.html', template, projectsString)

// create legal disclosure page
const legalString = await readFile('./src/template/impressum.html', 'utf8')
await helpers.prepareSite('impressum/index.html', template, legalString)

// create posts directory
for (var i = 0; i < posts.length; i++) {
  await helpers.prepareSite(`posts/${posts[i].file}.html`,
    template, posts[i].rendered)
}
```

The last thing to cover is the `helpers` module. It exports three methods: `postPreview`, `renderAndInsertDate`, and `prepareSite`. The `postPreview` method simply returns an `html` string, which contains the date of creation, the hyperlink to the actual post and the posts preview which will be displayed on the landing page. The `renderAndInsertDate` is used to render the markdown content of a post (using `markdown-it`), and to add a small info snippet again containing the posts date of creation, and the estimated reading time.
At last, the `prepareSite` methods simply splits the `index.html` template file at the `<!--* content goes here *--> ` comment, and injects the content.

```js
module.exports = {
  postPreview(post) {
    return `<a href="${post.url || 'posts/' + post.file + '.html'}" class="post-preview">
        <h3 class="post-preview-header">${post.title}<h3 class="post-preview-link">â†ª</h3></h3>
        <div class="post-preview-body">
          <p>
          ${post.preview}
          <info datetime="">
            ${post.month} ${post.year} ${post.readingTime ? 'â€” ' + post.readingTime : ''}
          </info>
          </p>
        </div>
      </a>`
  },
  renderAndInsertDate(post) {
    const html = md.render(post.__content)
    // add date, and estimated reading time
    const snippet = `<info datetime="${post.date.toISOString()}">
      ${post.date.toLocaleString('en-EN', { 
        year: 'numeric', 
        month: 'long', 
        day: 'numeric' 
      })} ${post.readingTime ? 'â€” ' + post.readingTime : ''}
    </info>`
     return html.split('</h1>')[0] + '</h1>' + snippet + html.split('</h1>')[1]
  },
  async prepareSite(name, template, content) {
    const first = template.split('<!--*')[0]
    const second = template.split('*-->')[1]
    await writeFile(name, `${first}\n${content}\n${second}`, 'utf8')
  }
}
```
